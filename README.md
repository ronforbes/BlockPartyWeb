# BlockPartyWeb
A repository for a modern successor to Tetris Attack on the web

## Prototype overview

The current prototype renders a 6×12 playfield in Three.js with a partially
filled stack of colourful blocks. A two-wide cursor highlights the active pair
so you can begin experimenting with horizontal swaps.

### Controls

- Arrow keys — move the two-block cursor around the playfield.
- Space or Enter — swap the two highlighted blocks.

### Run locally

This version is entirely client-side. Open `index.html` in any modern browser to
try it out.
